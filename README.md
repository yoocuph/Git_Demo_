# Beejan Technologies Customer Complaints Data Pipeline Design

## Overview
This document outlines the conceptual design for an end-to-end data pipeline to manage customer complaints at Beejan Technologies. The pipeline consolidates data from disparate sourcesâ€”social media, call center logs, SMS, and website forms into a unified, clean, and enriched dataset for actionable insights. The focus is on high-level concepts, laying the groundwork for a scalable and reliable implementation without specifying tools.

## Source Identification
Customer complaints originate from multiple channels:
- Social media (e.g., Twitter/X, Facebook)
- Call center logs
- SMS messages
- Website form submissions

Each source has unique data formats, which are addressed in the ingestion strategy. A conceptual pipeline diagram is available [here](https://app.diagrams.net/#G1Q6-C6vSTTvYpozUAzoBoBcfAoq0VJ2q6#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22YAdXhPD0bkcFhFQVbSi1%22%7D) for reference.

## Ingestion Strategy
The pipeline ingests data using a combination of API ingestion, streaming, and batch file uploads, tailored to each source's characteristics:

1. **Call Center Data** - API Ingestion or Batch File Uploads  
   Stored in systems like customer relationship management platforms (e.g., Salesforce), call center data is typically structured (e.g., CSV or XLSX). Batch file uploads suit daily exports of logs or transcripts, while APIs enable periodic pulls for fresher data.

2. **Log Files** - Batch File Uploads  
   Server or application logs containing complaint-related entries are semi-structured and aggregated periodically (e.g., hourly or daily). Batch uploads are ideal due to their volume and aggregation frequency.

3. **SMS** - API Ingestion or Streaming  
   SMS data, often received via providers in JSON payloads, supports near-real-time processing for urgent complaints (e.g., outages). Streaming is preferred for timeliness, with batch API pulls for less urgent cases.

4. **Website Forms** - API Ingestion or Batch File Uploads  
   Web form submissions (e.g., Google Forms) are structured and stored in databases or exported as JSON/CSV. APIs are ideal for direct database access, while file uploads suit periodic exports.

5. **Social Media (e.g., Twitter/X, Facebook)** - Streaming or API Ingestion  
   Social media requires real-time or near-real-time ingestion due to the fast-paced nature of public complaints. Streaming APIs capture posts mentioning the brand, supplemented by batch API calls for historical data.

**Raw Data Storage**: All data is initially stored in a data lake to preserve raw formats for historical analysis and machine learning. This ensures access to both raw and processed data.

## Processing and Transformation

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Use regex-based keyword rules to filter relevant complaints, especially for social media, using telecom-specific terms (e.g., "data," "network," "4G," "bandwidth").  
   - Normalize data by removing emojis, hashtags, and inconsistencies.

2. **Standardization and Enrichment**  
   Extract and standardize key fields:  
   - `complaint_text`  
   - `timestamp`  
   - `user_id`  
   - `source` (e.g., social media, call center, SMS)  
   - `complaint_category` (e.g., network, billing, customer service)  
   - `sentiment_score` (e.g., "no signal" = 0.8, "non-functional signal" = 1.0)  
   - `geographical_location` (especially for social media)  
   Enrichment adds context, such as sentiment scores or location data, to enhance analytics.

## Storage Options
The cleaned, standardized, and enriched data is stored in a structured format optimized for querying, analytics, and reporting (e.g., dashboards for complaint trends or sentiment scores).  

**Recommendation**: Use a cloud-based data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery or Snowflake) to handle large data volumes.  

**Data Format**: Parquet is the primary choice due to its columnar, compressed structure, optimized for big data analytics. It supports efficient querying, partitioning (e.g., by date or source), schema evolution, and metadata storage (e.g., schema, compression type, creation date) for performance and traceability.

## Serving
1. **Querying**  
   Standardized data in Parquet files is queried via SQL in the data warehouse. Example query:

   ```sql
   SELECT category, AVG(sentiment_score), COUNT(*)
   FROM complaints
   WHERE timestamp >= '2025-09-01' AND source = 'Tiktok'
   GROUP BY category;
   ```

   **Tools**: BI platforms (e.g., Tableau, Power BI), SQL clients (e.g., DBeaver), or warehouse web interfaces.

2. **Downstream Users**  
   - **Customer Service Teams**: Prioritize urgent complaints (e.g., high-negative sentiment) via dashboards or alerts integrated tools.  
   - **Analysts**: Generate reports on trends (e.g., network issues by region) for operational improvements.  
   - **Marketing/PR**: Monitor social media sentiment to address public complaints or campaigns.  
   - **Data Scientists**: Train ML models (e.g., churn prediction) using standardized data.  
   - **Executives**: View aggregated metrics (e.g., complaint volume, average sentiment) on dashboards for strategic decisions.  
   - **Integration**: Data is fed into CRMs, ticketing systems, or real-time apps via APIs or batch exports.

## Orchestration and Monitoring
- **Workflow Coordination**: Schedule jobs for real-time sources (e.g., social media every 30 minutes) and batch sources (e.g., hourly or daily, based on trade-offs).  
- **Monitoring**: Track pipeline health for missing records, job failures, or data lags. Alerts are sent via email for anomaly detection.  
- **System Management**: A dedicated system oversees task scheduling and monitoring.

## DataOps
Use applications to automate, observe, and monitor pipeline patterns and performance. Version control (e.g., Git) is applied to scripts and configurations for traceability.

## Challenges
- **Data Variety**: Diverse formats (JSON, CSV, text) require robust parsing and cleaning.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: High-velocity data from Twitter/X and SMS demands scalable streaming.  
- **Data Quality**: Duplicates, missing fields, or inconsistent categories need automated validation.  
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA mandates encryption and anonymization for customer data.  
- **Scalability**: Growing complaint volumes require efficient storage (Parquet) and partitioning.  
- **Cost Management**: Optimize compute costs with cloud-native scheduling and spot instances.  
- **Iterative Approach**: Start with one source (e.g., SMS) and scale to others for reliability.
